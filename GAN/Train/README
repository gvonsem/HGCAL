I have added the gan_test script for getting an idea.
Right now it works with convolutional filters, but everything needed for the graphs is already in the small converted test sample.
This sample is in:
/eos/home-j/jkiesele/DeepNtuples/GraphGAN_test

The training files can be found in 'conv', the test ones in 'test'.
